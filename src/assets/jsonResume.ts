    "summary": "I am a fresh graduate in Hospitality Management with a few F&B working experiences in restaurant, hotel, and catering business. I am a heart-driven person with a strong work ethic inherited from my family and - even if I enjoy taking up responsibilities on my own to prove myself - what I enjoy the most is working within a team of other equally passionate people. As my study path may suggest, I do love traveling, different cultures, and building longlasting social relationships. That makes it an obvious choice for me to invest my future in the fields of tourism and hospitality.",
