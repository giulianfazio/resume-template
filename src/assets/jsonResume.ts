    "summary": "Hello Reader with a little time, here is short summary of myself for you. Enjoy the read!<br>Professionally speaking, I am a mid-level Software Engineer as well as a Magnolia-certified developer with a preference for backend technologies and Java, which is the language I am most experienced with. I have an educational background in Computer Science and electronics (and a secret crush on Chemistry but I never acted on it). I am really eager to get that set of skills which may give me that \"senior engineer mindset\" and — unsurprisingly — this is now my main short-term goal. On the way there, I\'ve had the chance to experiment with AI — especially with neural networks and genetic algorithms — and that\'s how I sadly got a new tech crush. I feel extremely grateful when I think that I have managed to transform my passion — programming — into my daily job and I feel lucky whenever I get the chance to work with people who share my passion.",
